If they are the boot will continue as always. If a plugin is not installed, it will perform a `vagrant plugin install 'packagename'` and continue. If the package does not exists or there is a problem with the installation, the application will exit with an error code.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# -*- mode: ruby -*-\r\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\r\n\r\nrequire File.dirname(__FILE__)+\"./dependency_manager\"\r\n\r\ncheck_plugins [\"vagrant-exec\", \"vagrant-hostsupdater\", \"vagrant-cachier\", \"vagrant-triggers\"]\r\n\r\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\r\n\r\n  config.vm.box = \"base\"\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Invoking\r\n\r\nJust `vagrant up` or `vagrant reload` as usual!\r\n\r\n_**Danger:** this is so easy to use that you could forget that you are checking for missing dependencies every time you bootstrap your machine :D_\r\n\r\n#### Bypass the dependency manager\r\n\r\nYou might want to skip the dependency manager proccess that runs just before Vagrant. If it's your case, you can up your Vagrant machine as always with the `--skip-dependency-manager`` parameter before the Vagrant command.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nvagrant --skip-dependency-manager up\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Remember: if you type the vagrant command before the `--skip-dependency-manager` paramter you will get an error because Vagrant tries to run an invalid option_\r\n",
