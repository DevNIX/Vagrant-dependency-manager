  "body": "# Vagrant dependency manager\r\nSimple snippet that allows you to define a list of plugins in your Vagrantfile, and manage them as dependencies.\r\n\r\nI am not a Ruby programmer (yet) and this is a young software, so any issues and pull requests are always welcome! \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nJust clone this package on the folder you will always do `vagrant up`, or just paste `dependency_manager.rb` on that directory.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nInclude `dependency_manager.rb` in your Vagrantfile and call the function `check_plugins` with an array of plugin names.\r\n\r\n`Vagrant dependency manager` will check if the named plugins are installed. If they are the boot will continue as always. If a plugin is not installed, it will perform a `vagrant plugin install 'packagename'` and continue. If the package does not exists or there is a problem with the installation, the application will exit with an error code.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# -*- mode: ruby -*-\r\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\r\n\r\nrequire File.dirname(__FILE__)+\"./dependency_manager\"\r\n\r\ncheck_plugins [\"vagrant-exec\", \"vagrant-hostsupdater\", \"vagrant-cachier\", \"vagrant-triggers\"]\r\n\r\nVagrant.configure(2) do |config|\r\n\r\n  config.vm.box = \"base\"\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\n",
